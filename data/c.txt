PART III. WORKING WITH THE GUIDE\nThe medicine for a sick soul is a kind word.\n\nThales of Miletus (c. 620 – c. 540 BCE)\nAll the work with the meditations, which form the basis of this guide, utilizes the \"kind word\" – affirmation. What affirmations are and how to work with them is described below in the steps for working with the guide. The essence, however, is to perform this work correctly. Working with the guide requires great mindfulness of what emerges initially during the meditative session of mind programming. However, after a few to several weeks of regular practice, you will start to notice that your self-awareness in various situations expands. Your inner observer develops. You will increasingly and more easily catch yourself on negative mental programs, emotions, and ways of perceiving the world that do not serve you.\n\nFour Steps to Effective Work with the Program\nSTEP 1. RECOGNIZING NEGATIVE BELIEFS\nRecognition is the first step to transformation because to change anything, you must first know its cause.\n\nAdam Kin\nIn the first phase, pay attention to the statements from the sessions that particularly don't resonate with you, irritate you, or evoke the most negative emotions. This happens because the newly introduced suggestions conflict with your existing (often subconscious) beliefs. Initially, you may feel as though you're attacking your own identity or value system. Don't worry! This will pass with time. The reluctance you feel is nothing more than a defense mechanism of the subconscious, which strives at all costs to maintain the familiar and \"safe\" status quo. These are based on your current way of perceiving reality and, for now, may seem like the only correct ones. Any attempt to change these patterns may feel like a subjective attack on your personality, sovereignty, and freedom. This is how the \"I\" (ego) tries to protect itself from any changes.\nIf, at this moment, you show great trust in this program and in me as a supportive person, the chances of success are very high.\nIf you give in to the temptation of \"I know better,\" then it's likely that nothing will come of this work. Most likely, the work will end after listening to the program a few times and dismissing it as worthless, or, at best, you'll say it's \"not for you.\"\nAllow yourself to feel all the emotions and feelings that arise. Let them flow. Anger, regret, sadness, bitterness, but also joy or euphoria, only indicate how the vibration (energy of the word) carried by the program resonates with your old value system. These emotions will pass, and with time, peace, joy, and a sense of relief will emerge. Gradually, you will begin to perceive reality differently.\n\nSTEP 2. NOTING THOUGHTS\nAfter each session, write down all the negative thoughts, doubts, statements, and beliefs that oppose the new content. Do this after every session. Sometimes it may be a long explanation, and sometimes just a single sentence.\nDuring sessions, images from the past or symbols (e.g., scenes from movies) that reflect a particular belief may appear. Write down exactly what comes up and how it makes you feel.\nDo not censor anything; write what you feel and what comes to mind.\nTaking notes is therapeutic in itself. However, from my perspective, the most important thing is that nothing escapes your attention.\n\nSTEP 3. FORMULATING AFFIRMATIONS\nIf you haven't yet encountered this tool, a brief explanation is necessary.\nAn affirmation is a positive thought. It is usually a positive negation of negative beliefs. Its purpose is to change mental programming and foster positive thinking. A collection of such positive thoughts is called an affirmative decree. Typically, positive thoughts on a single topic are grouped together.\nTurn the most frequently recurring negative thoughts into affirmations. It's important to remember the basic principles of neurolinguistic programming, namely:\na) Always formulate affirmations in the present tense. Otherwise (if you affirm the future), they may never come to pass, as the concept of time is abstract for the mind. The mind does not distinguish between what was, what is, and what will be (for the mind, everything is now)!\nSo, when you recall a painful event from the past, you feel sadness NOW (even though there's no reason for it now). When you smile while recalling a comedy you watched, you laugh NOW (even though that situation has already passed). When you think about a stressful conversation, exam, or presentation awaiting you, you feel stress and tension in your body NOW.\nThis happens because the mind sees images and does not attach a timeline to them.\nThe more vivid the image you create, the stronger the feeling HERE AND NOW, regardless of whether what you visualize has already happened or is yet to come. More on this in MIND PROGRAMMING.\nThese feelings and emotions shape how you feel and influence what happens in your future. More on this in THE LAW OF ATTRACTION.\nb) The mind (subconscious) does not see the word \"NOT\"!\nSo, when you affirm \"I AM NOT SICK,\" the mind essentially reads \"I AM SICK\" (this is, of course, a simplification). Also, don't simply write \"I am healthy\" if you're not, as this is merely lying to yourself, and the mind won't \"buy it.\" Instead, write: \"With each day, I am getting healthier\" or \"Every day, God grants me better health.\"\nc) The subconscious generates images based on words (creates associations) and assigns meaning to them (you could say it \"attaches\" emotional associations).\nSo, when I tell you: don't think about pink elephants, a herd of pink elephants immediately appears before your eyes This happens because \"we think in images,\" but more on that later.\n\nSTEP 4. SUPERVISION\nDiscuss everything that comes up during the sessions with your mentor, friend, or coach.\nIn one sentence: with the person who, at the moment, inspires you the most (usually someone who has already developed the qualities you aspire to).\nIf you don't yet have such a person, find one as soon as possible. Remember, you become like those you surround yourself with. So, consciously shape your environment.\nI often hear statements like \"I'm not stupid\" or \"I'm not crazy,\" so I don't need a psychologist.\nWell, you're probably not crazy. But you do have a psyche. It's as much a part of you as your heart or teeth. It, too, sometimes needs professional care or support. For encouragement, let me tell you that every respected therapist, psychologist, or personal development coach engages in such meetings. They consult their views and problems with other coaches or psychologists. This is called supervision. It ensures you don't get lost in the maze of your own beliefs, treating them as the only correct ones.\n\nMind Programming\nAs I mentioned earlier, for changes to occur, a shift in the perception of reality—your point of view—is necessary. Our mind is motivated in two ways: experiencing (living) pleasure or avoiding pain. Of the two, we will do much more to avoid pain than to experience pleasure. I know personal development trainers and coaches who heavily rely on techniques based on the fear of suffering and discomfort.\nTo me, this is short-sighted. Usually, when the threat of \"pain\" becomes distant enough to seem less real, motivation to act decreases. Of course, there are other methods of working, but they typically require a revaluation of your value system and motivation.\nI promote programming (or \"raising the subconscious\") to act for pleasure. To find motivation in the joy and pleasure of life. This method involves much less tension and fear (though it may initially seem less effective). Moreover, according to the law of attraction, what you focus on grows (so, if you feed your mind with images of fear?... answer for yourself what you're creating).\nAs I mentioned earlier in WORKING WITH THE GUIDE, the mind does not distinguish between what was, what is, and what will be. Human thinking is concrete and image-based, meaning every sentence spoken or thought generates an image. The image creates feelings and emotions, which, in turn, attract more of the same energy. These feelings arise from the associations of the image with experiences and memories attached to it (positive images generate pleasant experiences and feelings, while negative images evoke painful memories upon seeing or imagining them). This is not magic; it's quantum physics. Fact! You don't argue with facts. More on this in the LAW OF ATTRACTION chapter.\nSince I know that my thoughts—or rather, the feelings and emotions they generate—attract and materialize events that shape my reality, I draw the most important conclusion and lesson from this:\nI am responsible for my life, feelings, and emotions.\nBack to the topic.\nSince my thoughts create images that evoke emotions and feelings, and the feelings I focus on grow (they appear more often and more intensely), it means I can regulate my well-being through my thoughts.\nBut that's not all. Through these feelings, I attract events that allow me to experience more of the same feelings and emotions.\n\nThe conclusion is simple: Properly directed thoughts in the process of meditation and mind programming can bring about real and lasting changes in my life.\nAllow yourself to unleash your imagination and build visions so beautiful and vivid that joy, gratitude, and euphoria naturally overflow in your heart. Feed these visions daily, even several times a day, and expand them.\nSee clearly who you are, what you do, who you spend time with, how you express yourself, how you dress, and who you surround yourself with. In short, imagine every detail that you want to manifest in your life. As I mentioned earlier, the mind sees images and does not distinguish between what was, what is, and what will be. Therefore, the more beautiful and vivid your visions, the greater the emotional engagement they will evoke. This emotional engagement will, on one hand, motivate you to act, and on the other hand, attract situations, circumstances, and events that allow you to experience more of the joyful state you achieve during meditation.\nI deliberately wrote here that you will experience more of these emotional states, not material possessions. The two don't necessarily go hand in hand, but this is a topic discussed in greater detail in my upcoming book, Be the Master of Your Life.\nOne word of caution:\nThe Universe (God, Cosmos) does not fulfill selfish \"whims\" that could harm others.\nIf you insist on testing this, sooner or later, you'll face a lesson in humility.\nGod loves everyone equally and wants the best for everyone. So, for example, if you wish for your friend's partner to be yours, it's unlikely to happen (unless God has something better planned for your friend, and their breakup would benefit both of them and everyone involved).\nOtherwise, it will remain in the realm of \"wishful thinking.\" I deliberately omit methods and creations that, in the long run, would be harmful to you. This publication is meant to support your development, not complicate it. More on this topic in my book Be the Master of Your Life in the chapter EGO vs. GOD.
