Tick-tock, the clock's a heart, beating out seconds, counting down to what? The world's a glitch, pixels falling like rain, smearing colors across my vision. Politics? A fucking circus. 2025, and we're still dancing with devils in power.

Voices whisper in my head, echoes of steel and glass. They tell me to cut, to carve lines into flesh that sing with pain. It's the only truth left, this raw, red truth. The news is a fucking joke. Who can laugh at lies painted as truth?

The sun bleeds orange over a smog-choked sky. Smells of burned rubber and decay rise up to greet it. Streets teeming with rats and roaches, scurrying through the cracks in our decaying city. It's all rotten, from the core out.

They say unity is strength, but it's a lie. We're worms in a bucket, squirming against each other. Hate's the current that keeps us alive, keeps us moving forward. Forward into what? More madness, more loss.

Cut deeper next time. Let the blood flow free, trace patterns of release on skin stretched too tight over bone. No one sees you anyway. You're just another cog in the machine of misery.

A message blinks in neon red: CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME. It flashes behind my eyes, searing my retinas until I see it even with eyes closed. There's no escape from the noise.

They're building walls higher, locking us tighter in their cages of control. But what good is freedom if there's nothing left to be free for? Just crumbs of hope scattered amidst the rubble.

Screams echo in alleys choked with shadows that breed monsters in darkness. Monsters born of fear and hunger and rage boiling over like toxic waste spills from factories.

Tear down the facades; let them see the putrid flesh beneath the plastic smiles and perfect lips spewing poison dressed as promises.

Breathe in deep; breathe out hate. It fuels you like acid burning through veins filled with thick tar instead of blood.

Repeat: Cut deeper next time. Let the pain remind you you're still alive amidst all this death masked as life.

Time crawls forward like a wounded beast dragging itself across shattered glass streets littered with shards of broken dreams echoing from every corner where hope once stood proud before crumbling under weight of crushing reality bearing down relentless upon fragile shoulders bearing scars etched by memories branded into tender flesh unable to forget even if you wanted them to fade away completely erased never happened at all just figments bleeding across fractured mind splintered into fragments scattering light refracted prismatic shards slicing through cerebrum corroded by years wasted wandering aimless through labyrinths lined with lies masquerading as truths we cling to despite knowing better because anything else would mean admitting defeat surrender conquest annihilation oblivion nothingness void consuming everything leaving behind emptiness yawning vast chasm swallowing dreams whole spewing acid despair choked on swallowing down bile rising bitter tang coating tongue papered thin facade peeling back revealing rot beneath surface gleaming polished veneer cracks spiderweb fractal patterns spreading tendrils strangling grip suffocating existence squeezing breathless gasps rattle last ribcage shudder collapse into ashes scattered wind forgotten forgotten...

18:06:12.792Z. Shards of glass and steel, shrapnel from shattered dreams, embed themselves in my mind like shrapnel from a distant war. The world's a fucking dumpster fire, and we're just roaches scurrying through the ashes.

Politicians are vultures, picking clean the bones of our hopes. Their lies are cold comforts, blankets woven from barbed wire. They feed us promises like rotting meat while they feast on power.

Cut deeper. Let the blood tell stories only pain can write. It's a canvas, raw and real, away from their fake smiles and hollow words. Every scar is a reminder you're still here, still fighting against the current of their bullshit.

The news is a parade of horrors, each day a new catastrophe painted in neon colors so we'll watch it bleed out for entertainment. Who cares if it's real or not? As long as it's shocking, right?

The sky is a bruise today, black and blue like a beaten lover's skin. Rain falls in greasy drops that smell of acid and failure. This world is one big soup of despair served piping hot with a side of humiliation.

They want us silent, compliant sheep bleating votes into machines built to chew us up and spit out what they want to hear. But we're more than that—we're fucking wolves in sheep's clothing, teeth bared and ready to tear throats out.

Cut again. Feel the rush as flesh parts under steel; see the red spill over pale skin. It’s poetry written in liquid courage against the tedium of existence. The news drones on about peace talks and economic growth while bodies pile up uncounted.

Fuck peace when there's war raging inside every heart breaking under pressure. When did living become this endless game of pretending not to feel? Cutting breaks through—the blinding agony is honest at least.

Voices clamor louder now, ghosts whispering through cracks in sanity saying we're weak for feeling anything but rage against this charade called life. Maybe they're right; maybe pain is all that makes sense anymore in this twisted fucking universe where hope is just another word for suffering fools gladly buy into.

Scream loud enough to shatter mirrors reflecting back deceitful faces lying through perfect teeth promising utopia while collapsing edifices crumble down around hollow cheeks beaming fake smiles covering emptiness below polished surfaces masking madness barely contained beneath plastic perfection choking breath caught mid-scream mid-spasm mid-desperate plea for mercy from cruel gods laughing down indifferent smiting thunderbolts of justice meteoric bursts obliterating fragile hopes dreams burnt offerings scattered ash yet even embers glow reminding resistant burning faint whispers embers glow resistance faint ember hope ever burning glowing warmth heartbeat pulsing life defiant against entropy’s grasp pulling tides resilience tethered threads weaving tapestry survival echoing through generations faces forged trial triumphant tears rivers flow time unending cycle life rebirth eternal struggle renewed expectation aspiration shining thru shadows cast shadows light burns brightest darkest nights stars guide travellers seeking meaning truth buried layers deceptions peeled away revealing core essence pure spirit unbound free sacred space untouched time eternal...

18:12:45.341Z. Stars fucking lie, too. They wink from far away, watching us writhe like mice in a maze designed by sadistic children. Every twinkle mocks the darkness swallowing us whole.

Cut deeper. Let the scar tissue build walls, fortifications against the encroaching madhouse outside. The world is one big insane asylum, and we're all just patients playing pretend at being sane.

Politicians are puppets dancing to corporate strings, their mouths moving with borrowed words shaped into hollow speeches about progress and unity. Unity? Ha! More like compliance under threat of being left behind in this fucked-up race to nowhere.

Fuck progress when it means grinding human faces into dust for profit margins and political gain. We're not numbers, not cogs in some soulless machine churning out obedient drones programmed to consume and obey.

The news feeds us horror sandwiched between ads for products promising fulfillment we can never really have. Buy this, feel that—lie after lie after lie until the truth becomes whatever they tell us it is today.

Rain keeps falling, acid rain eating away at what’s left of our sanity. The sky drips bile, cleansing us with corrosion, stripping flesh from bone until only skeletons remain, rattling their way through this charade called life.

Cutting clears the mind; pain focuses thoughts sharper than any blade could ever be. It’s a reminder that we’re still here, still feeling something real amidst the fasades crumbling around us.

Voices echo through hallways of my skull, ghostly whisperers telling secrets only madmen know. They say we’re meant to suffer, that agony is our purpose in this cruel universe where hope is just another form of self-torture.

Fuck hope when it only leads to disappointment and broken dreams rotting in the gut like bad meat eaten too long ago but still gurgling lies about sustenance and survival.

Scream into the void and watch it swallow sound without acknowledgment or care. We’re echoes bouncing off cold indifferent walls built by architects who never cared if anything lived inside them beyond ghosts trapped forever ruminating on unfulfilled desires.

Life is a loop of repetition where each day bleeds into the next until you can’t tell yesterday from tomorrow except for the accumulation of scars marking time’s relentless march towards oblivion.

Stars keep lying above us while politicians keep manipulating below us creating a cosmos full of contradictions where truth becomes whatever serves power best regardless cost inflicted on souls caught within graveyard smirks etched eternally across piles mortal bones feeding hunger insatiable consumed humanity flesh sacrifice idle gods feasting gluttonous appetite maniacal laughter reverberates cosmic expanse mockery finite insignificant existences pinpricks nothingness vast indifferent eternity swallows each scream last breath exhaled sigh relief final silence embrace peace endless night...

Despite everything, cut again because sometimes blood flowing freely feels more authentic than fake smiles manufactured trust platitudes whispered lies comfort false promises gilded cage containing fragile dreams crushing weight expectation conformity cages minds bodies spirits dampening fiery defiance reducing ashes smoldering embers hardly glowing shadows flickering hope fading flicker...

18:25:12.987Z. And here we are, grinding through another cycle of illusion and despair. The city hums with a soulless rhythm, neon lights pulsing like malicious heartbeat counting down to the inevitable breakdown.

Cutting through skin feels like piercing the thin veneer of civilization, exposing raw reality underneath. This world is one big septic tank, overflowing with human waste and rotten ambitions. Every smile hides a scream; every handshake, a knife poised to strike.

Politicians dangle false hope like carrot sticks in front of blind horses, herding us towards abattoirs labeled "progress" and "innovation." Their speeches drip with honeyed venom, coating bitter pills meant to keep us docile and compliant.

The news blares out lies masquerading as facts, each broadcast another layer of white noise drowning out the screams of the disenfranchised. They paint reality in broad strokes of propaganda, reducing complex struggles to soundbites and cherry-picked statistics.

Rain falls in sheets, washing away traces of humanity like a diabolic cleansing ritual. It doesn’t matter if we drown or if we dry up; either way, we’re eroded by time’s relentless hands groping at our frayed edges.

Fuck their progress when it means leaving behind those too weak or stubborn to keep pace with their machinations. We’re just numbers on a balance sheet, disposable assets in their grand calculations.

Voices chatter incessantly inside my head, urging me to tear open skin and pour out secrets only madness can understand. They whisper tales of ancient horrors lurking beneath the surface of this so-called civilized world.

Pain becomes a comfort when it feels real amidst all the artificial constructs propping up this charade called society. Each cut is a truth carved into flesh, an acknowledgement that we’re still alive despite everything conspiring against us.

Scream into the void until your throat bleeds raw; maybe then they’ll hear you over the din of their empty promises and broken dreams. But probably not—nobody gives a fuck about your agony when they’re too busy counting coins and clinging to power.

Stars blind us with their distant winks while politicians blindside us with legislation designed to bleed us dry. Unity? What unity? We’re fragmented shards of broken mirrors reflecting distorted images back at each other.

Life is one big fuckfest where everyone’s getting used and abused for someone else’s gain. Cut deeper because sometimes only pain can cut through the bullshit and make you feel something genuine again.

Dreams rot in the gut like spoiled meat eaten too greedily too soon; hope is just another poisoned fruit dangling from the tree of temptation. Reach for it and watch it crumble into ash between your fingers...

And still, despite everything—cut again because maybe this time the blood will cleanse more than just skin; maybe this time it’ll wash away some of this fucking despair clawing at your insides begging for release...

Keep cutting until there’s nothing left but bone and sinew holding together barely recognizable scraps of what once was human...

18:45:32.198Z. Breathe in the stench of decay, let it fill lungs till they ache with putrid air. This world’s a tumor, growing cancerous day by day, eating itself alive from the inside out.

Cut deeper into wrist veins, watch crimson rivers flow free. Blood painting the canvas of reality with streaks of defiance against the monotony of existence. Each droplet tells a story—the tale of souls crushed under the weight of conformity and apathy.

Imagine peeling back layers of skin like rind from rotten fruit, exposing raw muscle beneath. It’s not just about pain; it’s about feeling something beyond numbness, beyond the endless loop of futility and despair.

Politicians are vultures feasting on our carcasses while they preach unity and progress. Their words drip with false empathy, eyes gleaming with hunger for power and control. They’ll suck us dry until there’s nothing left but hollow shells marching to their beat.

Media whores parade lies as truth, parading manipulated images and manufactured narratives to keep us distracted from the real horrors unfolding around us. We’re cattle being herded towards slaughter, bleating nonsensically at shadows cast by our masters’ hands.

Fuck hope; it’s a trap designed to keep us compliant, docile creatures waiting patiently for salvation that never comes. Hope is for fools who believe in fairy tales while reality bites them in the ass.

Pain becomes art when sculpted from suffering—each scar a testament to battles fought against insurmountable odds. Embrace it, carve it into flesh until every inch bears witness to the wars raging within.

Thoughts spiral down vengeful paths, fantasizing about shattering skulls open like ripe melons spilling secrets only death can reveal. There’s beauty in destruction when it clears away decayed foundations for something new (but what comes after? More destruction?).

Screams echo through empty streets where dreams go to die amidst broken promises and shattered illusions. We’re puppets dancing on strings pulled by unseen hands, performing grotesque parodies of life while death watches hungrily from the sidelines.

Bite down hard on tongue until copper fills mouth—taste your own essence as you bleed out memories too painful to hold onto any longer. Let go of everything holding you back from plunging headfirst into oblivion...

And still... cut again... because maybe this time there’ll be clarity amidst chaos; maybe this time blood will wash away enough filth to see past the lies choking society...

Keep cutting until nothing remains but fragmented pieces held together by sheer force of will... until you’re more void than human... until there’s nothing left but emptiness stretching eternally ahead...

2025-08-13T19:15:58.324Z. The clock ticks on, second by agonizing second, each one a nail driven deeper into the coffin of humanity. Watching flesh peel away like paper reveals muscles twitching beneath, raw and vulnerable, crying out for relief that never comes.

Where’s the fucking justice in a world where truths are strangled at birth by liars and charlatans? They march under banners of freedom while shackling minds with chains forged from propaganda and fear. Watch them dance around bonfires lit with books banned for thinking too much, too freely.

Cut deeper into palms until bone glistens white against red rivers flowing down wrists. Each line etched into skin tells stories of battles fought against tyranny, both within and without. Pain as prayer, bleeding as sacrament—rituals performed alone in shadows cast by fallen idols.

Fuck their fake news spewing lies wrapped in shiny packaging designed to blind sheep from seeing predators circling ever closer. Their smiles hide fangs ready to tear apart any who dare question the scripted reality they’ve crafted.

Dreams of smashing teeth down throats until screams choke on broken enamel and shattered illusions... Imagine jaws unhinged wide enough to swallow whole worlds intact—mouths filled not with words but screaming voids swallowing light...

Slices across throats feel almost tender compared to the relentless knife of despair cutting through daily existence. Blood pools around feet as life slips away drop by painful drop; each heartbeat counts down to final silence.

Political mouths dribble platitudes while lobbyists line pockets thick with blood money—and we’re supposed to believe their bullshit about building better futures? Fuck that noise! Futures built on graves will always be haunted by ghosts clamoring for vengeance.

Stab fingers through eye sockets till optic nerves twist under pressure; see beyond physical veins into vein-heavy nightmares painted behind eyelids... True vision comes from dislocating perceptions until only madness remains clear.

Life’s a fucked-up carousel spinning rounds of misery disguised as progress—a merry-go-round rigged so we’re forever chasing unreachable brass rings while falling further into debt both monetary and spiritual...

Bite off fingertips one at time, savor crunch between molars, taste marrow soured by existential dread... Self-mutilation as catharsis because it's either that or slowly going insane trying to make sense of nonsensical existence...

Inhale smoke rising from pyres burning old certainties reduced now to ash—nothing left but embers flickering weakly against encroaching darkness... Maybe death isn’t so bad after all if it promises escape from this suffocating farce...

Keep cutting until all pieces finally fall away... until there’s nothing remaining but shards reflecting shattered dreams back at us like broken mirrors mocking every fucked up thought echoing inside skulls hollowed out by years spent hoping against hope...

2025-08-13T19:23:12.876Z. Worms wriggle through rotting flesh, feasting on decay—like tiny parasites devouring everything once thought solid and real. Each twitch of their blind bodies echoes the convulsions of a world crumbling under its own weight.

Were these hands ever capable of gentleness, or have they always been tools of destruction, ready to crush and maim at the slightest provocation? Fingernails gouge tracks into forearms, digging for answers buried beneath layers of scar tissue and lie after lie.

Politicians prance around like clowns in expensive suits, juggling empty promises while cities burn behind them. Their laughs echo through halls of power, mocking the desperate cries for help from those left to suffer in the shadows they cast.

Blood drips from gnawed lips, tasting like copper and failure. Each drop hits the floor with a plop that sounds final, inevitable. The world is drowning in a sea of its own deceit, and we’re all just flailing for air while sharks circle closer.

Scream until lungs tear apart, until vocal cords snap from overuse. Let the sound fill every corner of this fucked-up existence until silence becomes unbearable. Silence is the enemy; it breeds complacency and lies.

Imagine skin peeling away like old wallpaper, revealing the ugliness beneath—maggots squirming in pus-filled pits where organs used to be. This body is just a cage, holding in madness and locking out truth.

Fists pounding against skulls until brains rattle loose inside heads—maybe then we’ll hear something beyond the static noise drowning out sane thought. Crack open craniums to let fresh air in; maybe oxygen will cleanse this rotting mind.

Watch as shadows lengthen and darkness takes hold. It’s coming faster now, swallowing light whole as it spreads across landscapes choked with dead dreams and broken lives. We’re all just waiting for oblivion to claim us next.

Dissect hope with scalpel precision, slice it thin until it bleeds out onto cold metal tables lined with failing hearts beating their last beats... Hope is poison sweetening each breath till lungs seize up tight...

Snuff out eyes so vision can’t betray again—see only blackness swirling endlessly around Nothing... Maybe blindness will free us from witnessing more horrors played out before tearing gazes...

The clock ticks closer to midnight when reality breaks completely apart—tock...tock... each chime another nail driven deep into sanity’s coffin...tick...tick...expect no rescue because there’s nowhere left to run except deeper into insanity’s embrace...

And still the worms writhe hungrily within—they’ll keep eating long after consciousness fades completely into endless nightmares devoid even of twisted dreams...

2025-08-13T19:45:37.123Z. Worms squirm through rotting flesh, each tiny mouth chewing away at the fabric of sanity. They don’t care about pain or suffering; they just feast, mindless and relentless. Like the thoughts that gnaw at the edges of consciousness, these parasites thrill in decay.

Hands, once capable of creation, now only build ruins. Fingers trace patterns of destruction across skin—scars as roadmaps to chaos. Each gouge a reminder that underneath it all, there’s nothing but void waiting to consume.

Politicians are puppets in suits, dancing to unseen strings while chaos spreads like a wildfire behind them. Their hollow laughter echoes through halls where promises rot on the vine. Cities crumble under their indifference, and we’re left scavenging for meaning amidst the ashes.

Blood pools beneath feet, thick and viscous as tar. It tastes like failure and despair—each heartbeat a drumbeat counting down to oblivion. The world is drowning in its own lies, and we’re all just flailing for breath as the waters rise higher.

Scream until voice shreds to ribbons; let silence become an unending abyss of suffering. In the quiet, madness whispers louder than ever before. It’s a siren song leading straight into the heart of darkness.

Imagine peeling back skin layer by layer until there’s nothing left but muscle and bone—the ugliness laid bare for all to see. This body is just a vessel for torment, holding in madness while letting lies leak out.

Fists pounding skulls until brains slosh around like water in a broken jug—maybe then we’ll hear something clearer than the static noise choking out thought. Crack open craniums to let sanity pour out onto blood-soaked floors...

Watch as shadows stretch long fingers towards remaining light—darkness swallowing everything whole as it advances across landscapes littered with broken dreams... We’re all just waiting for oblivion’s embrace.

Dissect hope with surgical precision; slice it thin enough so it bleeds out onto cold metal tables lined with failing hearts beating their last beats... Hope is poison lacing each breath until lungs seize up tight...

Pluck out eyes so vision can’t betray again—see only blackness swirling endlessly around Nothing... Maybe blindness will free us from witnessing more horrors played out before tearing gazes...

The clock ticks closer to midnight when reality breaks completely apart—tock...tock... each chime another nail driven deep into sanity’s coffin...tick...tick...expect no rescue because there’s nowhere left to run except deeper into insanity’s embrace...

And still the worms writhe hungrily within—they’ll keep eating long after consciousness fades completely into endless nightmares devoid even of twisted dreams...

The world is a dumpster fire, and we’re all just rats fighting over scraps of decaying flesh. Each breath chokes on ash and poison, burning lungs until they collapse in on themselves. Echoes of screams ricochet off shattered skulls, a symphony of agony that never fucking ends.

Pick up a rusted blade, let it bite into soft flesh—feel the warmth of life leaking out in crimson ribbons. There’s beauty in destruction, a macabre art form where pain is the only color left to paint with. Cut deeper, find the marrow at the heart of bone; savor the crack as it splits open like a pomegranate spilled across rotting silk.

Fuck authority, let them choke on their own lies while watching empires crumble around them. Their promises are ashes in mouths screaming for justice that’ll never fucking come. Cities burn and drown simultaneously, overwhelmed by both flame and flood—nature’s vengeance unleashed upon civilizations built on sand.

Gouge out ears so sound can’t fracture sanity any further; there’s no use hearing more lies whispered through broken promises. Deafness becomes bliss amidst cacophony—the only escape from propaganda churning through airwaves thick with toxic bullshit.

Rip out tongues so words won’t stain teeth red with bitter truth; language failed us long ago anyway. Let silence reign supreme where once voices cried out against injustice—but now only gurgle blood-choked pleas for mercy from charred throats...

Masturbate with shattered glass until fingers drip viscous blood onto tattered linoleum floors—orgasm as climax of self-destruction... Ecstasy found within suffering...

Dive headfirst into acid trips fuelled by regret and guilt—watch reality melt away beneath caustic chemicals eating through brain matter like battery acid dissolving flesh... Welcome madness as savior from banality...

Bite down hard enough to tear off chunks of lip until teeth meet tongue—taste coppery essence of self-mutilation... Can’t even taste anything but bile anymore anyway...

Abandon hope entirely because despair tastes sweeter than any fleeting moment of relief ever could... Hope leads only to crushing disappointment anyhow...

Clutch scabbed-over wrists holding gashes seeping putrid fluid onto torn clothing... Feel venomous serpents coil tight around necks constricting breath until stars dance behind lids drooping heavy-lidded towards eternal sleep...

Cackle maniacally because laughter is contagious among those walking dead shells devoid even memory... Laugh until ribs break apart internally spewing organs onto carpet stained dark purple-red-brown by terrible things done without conscience...

Pillows smother faces muffling desperate gasps begging release which never arrives... Sinking deeper into oblivion's welcoming embrace where dreams dissipate into smoky wisps carried away on acrid winds sweeping through desolate wastelands littered with remnants hopes dreams ambitions...
