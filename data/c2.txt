1. A Few Universal Laws Governing the World, or the Engineering of the Universe in a Nutshell\n  To guide you step-by-step through the intricacies of practical personal and spiritual development, and to systematize certain information (in a \"telegraphic\" summary), I will outline a few universal laws governing the world.\n  I'll try to explain how it all works in the simplest way possible.\n  Since I'm not a quantum physicist and exact sciences are somewhat foreign to me, I'll use certain generalizations here, so some information may be incomplete. If you're more deeply interested in this topic, I recommend the works of quantum physicist Gregg Braden.\n  For some time now, quantum physicists have been proving through their discoveries that the entire universe is built from energy particles.\n  This topic is brilliantly presented in a fascinating dramatized documentary titled What the Bleep Do We Know!?. If you haven't seen this film yet and your personal and spiritual development is important to you, you must catch up on it. The creators very vividly and relatively simply show how the universe works, and your logical mind will get a dose of nourishment and answers to questions like:\n  \n  Why am I doing this?\n  Does it all make sense?\n  Does it really work?\n  Isn't this just some childish hocus-pocus?\n  \n  Let's get to the point.\n  \n  2. Everything is Energy (Humans as Energetic Beings)\n  As has been proven, the entire universe is built from energy particles. Some time ago, it was believed that the atom was the smallest particle, then the quantum, and currently, it's thought to be the quark. That's what we know so far.\n  However, the human mind remains unexplored, unfathomable, and timeless. Through meditation, prayer, and techniques for working with the mind, it reaches far beyond scientific understanding, revealing much more than we notice in everyday life.\n  Humans are also a form of energy (its densest manifestation). Within the body, a series of transformations occur, producing various types of energy (e.g., thermal energy, as evidenced by body temperature). A clear, observable proof of the energetic nature of humans is the static electricity in clothing or hair, which you've likely experienced. Eastern masters (including those practicing Chinese medicine) have systematized the types of energy and how they manifest in the body. These are the so-called meridians, or energy channels, along which energy flows. The existence of these energies and the benefits of their proper stimulation are increasingly recognized by doctors worldwide. In China, this has been successfully used for centuries, and for decades even in surgery as a natural form of anesthesia.\n  If the entire universe is energy, so too are air, water, and earth. Everyone has at least heard of generating electricity from hydroelectric plants, wind turbines, or fossil fuels like coal. Of course, this is processed energy. Just because you didn't previously notice the energy in the air or a lump of coal doesn't mean it wasn't there. If you have doubts, try holding your breath and see how long you can survive without air—just about four minutes. After that, irreversible changes begin in the brain. Can a person who is oxygen-deprived (with impaired lungs or heart) achieve good results in sports? No! Because oxygen in the air is the most critical form of energy our body draws from in various ways. If you want to test this empirically, try a series of 2–3-minute intense, rapid breathing exercises. You'll feel the effects firsthand. Every action, every activity we undertake causes changes in energy flows, which we don't always notice in the surrounding reality.\n  The simplest example is earning money for our work, which is essentially exchanging our energy for someone else's benefit. The payment we receive is then exchanged for food, material goods, or pleasures. This is the most common manifestation of human energy, yet no one has explicitly called it that. Did anyone immediately recognize the energy potential in wind? Was it immediately labeled a renewable energy source?\n  Thoughts and words are also energy. Our brain generates a series of thoughts. At the level of the nervous system, these are electrical impulses. The accumulation of these impulses creates an electromagnetic field around the head, which tangibly affects the surrounding reality (more on this in the section on the Law of Attraction). The vibration (energy) of words is measured in Hertz (Hz), which indicates the frequency of sound wave vibrations. \"And the Word became flesh \"—do you recognize this phrase? For the sake of clarity, I won't delve deeper into this topic here. I'll discuss it more extensively in my book Be the Master of Your Life.\n  \n  3. The Law of Cause and Effect\n  Every action triggers a reaction. If you hit a wall with your fist, the wall \"hits\" you back with the same force but in the opposite direction—that's physics. The end result is pain in your hand.\n  If you drop an object from a roof, it will fall to the sidewalk (cause and effect).\n  This same law applies to the subtler matter of human thought. Every thought (or more precisely, its energetic charge) is a cause and generates a specific effect.\n  If you think, \"I can't do it,\" \"It won't work,\" or \"I'm not good enough,\" you'll likely not even try or give up after the first failed attempt. Many such beliefs reside in our subconscious, but that's another topic. I'll explore this further in the section on the Law of Attraction.\n  \n  4. The Law of Attraction (The Law of Sympathy)\n  Let's expand on thoughts as a causal force (cause and effect).\n  Every thought carries an energetic charge (frequency, vibration) that we emit. According to the Law of Attraction, these thoughts act like a magnet, attracting other thoughts with similar emotional or energetic qualities.\n  This happens because only similar frequencies can meet and interact. Do you know the sayings \"being on the same wavelength\" or \"like attracts like\"? In short, positive vibrations (positive people) attract more positive events and people, while negative vibrations associated with complaining lead to more reasons to complain and people to complain with.\n  People \"on the same wavelength\" (literally, with the same energetic frequency) find a common language, attract each other, and draw similar events.\n  Every thought is a cause and generates an effect.\n  Positive thoughts rooted in the subconscious generate specific attitudes and expectations. Such an attitude naturally prompts certain actions, resulting in outcomes aligned with those expectations (i.e., conscious and unconscious thoughts).\n  Even if such an attitude is unconscious, it still generates positive outcomes (creations) in life. Such a person often says they \"just have good luck.\" They usually don't need to change anything in the areas of life where they think positively.\n  A common misunderstanding is wishful positive thinking, which is based on shallow self-awareness and often incorrect or incomplete conclusions about oneself and one's life.\n  For example: You feel fear. Instead of exploring its cause to replace the original negative thought with a positive one, you superficially overlay it with thoughts like \"everything will be fine.\" Such an approach is doomed to fail.\n  (More on the differences and how to distinguish between wishful thinking and true, hidden attitudes in the full version of the book, in the chapter Thinking (Not) Always Positive).\n  The best examples of positively applying these laws are seen in the biographies of people who achieved material success.\n  Every successful person or inventor undeniably had a highly developed imagination, one of the mind's faculties. They were both dreamers and doers, boldly striving to realize their dreams and plans. Whether consciously or unconsciously, they devoted their energy to creating their desired reality.\n  Every unique project or plan began as an idea. An idea, or thought, is an intangible form of energy residing in the mind. Many business tycoons, before building their empires, visualized massive production halls in their minds. They saw people operating machines, teams of workers harmoniously fulfilling their duties.\n  But most importantly, they didn't have as many conflicting, self-negating beliefs as those who fail. Why? Because, as mentioned earlier, thoughts and attitudes shape behaviors, which lead to action or inaction.\n  \"I can, I'm capable, I'm valuable\"   I act.\n  \n  \"I can't, it won't work, I'm worthless\"   I'll just give up (inaction).\n  These same laws also have a negative pole (\"negative\" attraction).\n  Have you heard the everyday saying, \"Don't jinx it, or it'll happen\"? Or perhaps you've used it yourself? People often say, \"They jinxed it, and it happened.\" In most cases, they're not fully aware of the wisdom in these words. This \"jinxing\" refers to expressing statements, thoughts, or beliefs—often negative—about a situation. Negative thinking comes more easily to modern humans than positive thinking and sells better in the media.\n  Positive thinking requires conscious thought management, mental discipline, and some effort (especially at the start of any \"conscious journey\").\n  The saying \"misfortunes come in pairs\" is often used because, after one misfortune, another typically follows. This happens to people whose subconscious runs this ingrained program (this is their unconscious expectation). Their mind believes it, and what you believe comes true.\n  I know people who carry this program in their minds. If their children get sick, it's usually both at once. If their TV breaks, the washing machine soon follows. They constantly say they've never had just one misfortune or stroke of bad luck.\n  These simple principles of energy flow determine your life, its quality, and your way of existence.\n  Your thoughts program your life. You now know what your successes and failures depend on.\n  \n  5. The Law of Growth\n  What you focus on, what you give your attention and thoughts to, grows around you because the accumulation of thoughts \"densifies\" and takes material form. Simply put, your expectations (often unconscious), or more precisely, the net result of positive and negative thoughts, manifest in your life.\n  The way you think determines the actions you take (or don't take), what you nurture, and what you neglect.\n  Are you starting to see the sense and wisdom in the saying, \"We are all the architects of our own fate\"?\n  I've already mentioned, but it's worth repeating, that certain laws governing the flow of our energy prevent us from shaping the future according to our whims—namely, love (God) and the highest common good of all beings in the world. But that's another topic.\n  This covers the most important theoretical-philosophical and psychological-spiritual aspects (at least at this stage).\n  Now it's time to explore the commentary on individual modules in more detail.\n  The commentary aims to encourage your own exploration and reflection while also satisfying the logical part of human nature that wants to know, \"Why do I need this?\"\n  What's the point of these practices, and what do they actually contribute?\n  The insights and inspirations here will be a reminder for some and a valuable source of new knowledge for others.
