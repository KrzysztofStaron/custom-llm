PART IV. MEDITATIONS FOR A MASTERFUL LIFE\nIntroduction to Relaxation\nThe introduction must be listened to at the beginning. It serves to open the session using keys (mind-working methodologies) and to guide the mind into a state of relaxation, meaning slowing down the racing thoughts and nervous impulses from the beta state to the alpha state (the alpha state is similar to the state just before falling asleep). Suggestions introduced in this state are more easily and deeply absorbed into the subconscious, modifying beliefs, and consequently, behaviors and attitudes.\nWhen the flow (impulses) of brain waves slows down, we become more attentive and self-aware. We start noticing emotions, feelings, and thoughts that we previously overlooked. In the alpha state, the mind learns new skills faster because it can remember details with greater accuracy. This state is often used for quick and effective learning.\nThe human mind operates in the beta state during the day. In this state, we often fail to notice many emotions, thoughts, and situations around us. The mind is chaotic, and attention is usually scattered. We frequently experience various emotional states without even being aware of what influences us or why.\nOn a daily basis, thousands of thoughts pass through the mind, but we are consciously aware of only a few hundred. For example, thoughts about the weather, what to wear today, what tasks await us, or what needs to be done at work. Often, we feel like everything is fine, yet we experience a low mood. The logical mind then tries to match the mood to external circumstances to explain it. We make all sorts of projections, assuming it's because of the weather, someone giving us a strange look, or other pretexts to justify our emotional state.\nIMAGINING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BETA AND ALPHA STATES\nImagine driving a car at 200 km/h. The images outside the window are blurry, colors blend together, and the noise prevents you from hearing sounds clearly. You can't notice details or smell anything. This is the BETA state.\nThe alpha state is as if the car slowed down to 30 km/h. The images outside become clear; you can count the windows in houses and buildings, see flowers or decorations in those windows, notice the shade of the grass or the types of trees you pass, and spot a dog or cat outside. You can smell things. Everything becomes calmer and clearer. The reality hasn't changed; only your perception of it has.\nWhen your vehicle—your body and mind—slows down, you begin to connect with yourself, reaching the layers that make you feel good or bad in life. This way, you can recognize everything that sabotages your life, happiness, and success.\nRecognition is the first step toward transformation because, to change anything, you must first know its cause.\nOnce you know what limits you, you become more aware of the essence of the problem.\nHowever, this level of self-awareness doesn't yet guarantee change. At best, it brings more peace and acceptance of the situation (provided you can accept that I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY LIFE, for what I think, and what I attract). From that moment, you know!\nThe next step is deciding whether you want to make that change or not (and here, things can get more complicated). Do you take action or not? This isn't the place to delve too deeply into this topic, as it might blur the bigger picture.\nAnswering Questions You Might Be Asking Yourself\nWhy don't I allow myself to change?\nWhy don't I act, even though I know how?\nThese are perfect topics for developmental work with a coach during individual consultations. Such consultations are an excellent complement to working with this script.\nI notice that people I work with in this way achieve results faster. Why? Sometimes, a single phone call, Skype session, or in-person meeting can shift your perspective. It's hard to see your situation clearly when you're deeply immersed in it. It's difficult to recognize a flawed belief about yourself (especially if those beliefs are the only ones you know and consider valid). In such cases, the perspective of an experienced coach (ideally one who has gone through what you're experiencing) is invaluable.\nThis is a bit like a lost wanderer in a forest who must climb a tall tree to locate their position. From the ground, they can't see the broader picture.\nMANIFESTATION OF CHANGE (YOUR POINT OF VIEW DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT OF SEATING)\nFor change to manifest in the physical realm, a shift in perspective is necessary. This is where a coach, teacher, master, or even a random person you meet can help by offering a suggestion that guides you toward a new way of seeing the situation and thinking differently.\nHowever, for the filters through which we view the world to change permanently, reprogramming the mind is essential.\nYou can achieve this in many ways. I propose the program \"Meditations for a Masterful Life\", which contains valuable suggestions that can initially replace the need for a supervisor. Gradually introduced changes to your belief system will generate transformations in your actions and other aspects of life.\nDeep transformation is a process.\nIt is gradual and more like evolution than revolution. So, give yourself time and arm yourself with patience.\nWhy is this the case?\nThe human mind is malleable. Every thought about the world, people, life, and yourself is a specific energy bundle—a neural impulse. When such an impulse is repeated often, that neural pathway becomes stronger and more ingrained, forming a mental habit.\nThis programming begins in childhood and may never end.\nHowever, the core of personality is shaped in a child by the age of three. After that, we only talk about slight adjustments. Nonetheless, behavioral patterns are acquired throughout the process of upbringing and socialization.\nSome things cannot be explained. To notice and change them, experiences are necessary. Sometimes life provides these (which you often call \"lessons\").\nHowever, life and development don't have to be difficult or painful.\nYou can do some of this work through workshops. This is how we work with developmental-therapeutic groups during the \"Healthy Inner Child\" workshops, which are part of the two-year cycle of personal and spiritual development workshops \"Mastery of Life\".\nParticipants engage in various exercises and activities. Sometimes, they confront difficult stories and emotions hidden behind them. Through this, they recognize and release many old programs, childhood beliefs, and family or societal imprints.\nFor changes to be real, you must make real changes on deep spiritual levels and work with the subconscious.\nWhy? Because your state of consciousness will change.\nYour consciousness determines your existence. As your consciousness grows, your way of seeing the world changes, leading to different thoughts and actions.\nAs mentioned, the human mind is malleable and can be reprogrammed. It's somewhat like rehabilitation for people after strokes, where the mind loses certain functions, and an adult must relearn to speak, write, or walk, almost like a newborn. Anyone who has encountered such a person knows that success depends on their determination and belief. Every exercise, every task repeated multiple times, day after day, sends new impulses to the damaged structures of the nervous system. Repeated neural impulses gradually rebuild and create new neural connections. Once these pathways form, they need to be continuously stimulated until the transmission becomes smooth, stable, and automated.\nI often compare this physiological phenomenon to a forest path during our workshops. If a person walks a path once, they might only trample the grass. But if they walk it several times a day, the grass disappears, and the path becomes clearer. Gradually, the path becomes more frequented as others notice its convenience. If those responsible for the area notice this, they might pave it or improve the passage, making communication easier for residents.\nThe same happens with our thoughts and emotions. They also create their neural pathways. Parents, family, school, society, and religions have specific ways of being, thinking, and seeing the world. We adopt these thoughts as our own and identify with them. Many of them are destructive and contribute to what we (subjectively) call unhappiness.\nAND HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS!\nEvery such thought (neural pathway, mental habit) can be reprogrammed. Every habit can be modeled and changed. It's up to you whether you make that change or not. Now that you know this, the choice is yours.\nDO YOU CHANGE, OR DO YOU STAY THE SAME?\nFrom now on, every recognized negative thought, belief, or conviction should be relentlessly replaced with a positive counterpart. However, it's worth doing this systematically, focusing on a specific theme. More on this in the later parts of the guide.\nThe \"Meditations for a Masterful Life\" program is precisely such a tool, enabling you to radically transform your life. It will help you positively reprogram your mind, but above all, when used skillfully, it will help you uncover your own negative mental codes. This happens through provocation with positive content.\nSTRIKE THE TABLE, AND THE SCISSORS WILL RESPOND\nA subconscious mind unaccustomed to such content and not believing in it will rebel and bring up its own beliefs on the topic you're working on, as per the saying, \"Strike the table, and the scissors will respond.\" Note these thoughts, as they are the key to your own mind and will be useful for more detailed, personalized work with beliefs.\nIF YOU DON'T FORGIVE, YOU'LL GET STUCK IN THAT ENERGY\nEach of us comes from different experiences. Everyone had a different childhood, joys, sorrows, and traumas. There's no point in comparing whose past was harder, as these are purely subjective experiences. It seems to us that what we went through was terrible and difficult. In our own way, we suffer and carry the burden of childhood.\nTo avoid feeling pain and trauma, we find various ways to escape that state: sometimes through substances, workaholism, or an excess of other \"pleasures\" or \"hobbies.\" These are meant to prove something or make us feel differently than we did during painful experiences.\nThis usually happens on a subconscious level, and when asked \"Why?\" we casually respond, \"Because I like it!\"\nIt takes time, patience, attention, and willingness to \"thaw out,\" start feeling, and live life fully.\nThe process of awakening and growing consciousness happens naturally when we start working on ourselves.\nGradually, you recognize all the subconscious causes, beliefs, and attitudes that have influenced your life.\nDuring the period of unconsciousness, they determined your life decisions, and thus, what you experienced when you weren't in control or didn't understand the causes of those events (experiences), including in childhood.\nThe lack of understanding of these causes led to feelings of injustice, resentment, sadness, anger, and other related states.\nThese emotions shaped further choices and life decisions up to now, when your inner maturity has led you to the path of change. The book and subconscious-coding program you're working with are tools that can help you.\nFrom my fifteen years of experience, the process of forgiveness is one of the most important steps. Reconciling with the past, reevaluating decisions made under emotional influence, and making new ones is the way to better changes.\nWhen old traumatic experiences, erroneous, or limiting family or societal beliefs no longer influence your choices, you start acting differently. You make different decisions, often in a different way.\nThe hardest step is realizing the need to do this work. Participants in our Healthy Inner Child workshops (about rediscovering spontaneity, joy, and acting with passion) often say, \"I had no idea I needed this so much. I wondered why I was even going there; after all, my childhood was perfect.\"\nThis step marks the beginning of a new life path. You let go of many illusions about hurts and wrongs, gradually becoming the director of your own life.\nYou become the master and creator of your destiny instead of its victim.\nFrom the position of \"I can't do anything, life just happens to me and kicks me in the butt,\" you gradually move to the state of:\nI CAN, I AM CAPABLE, I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY LIFE and what happens in it.\nI AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY LIFE, MY FEELINGS, AND EMOTIONS.\nIf you're frowning or don't understand this now, catch up on the concepts of the law of attraction and mirror consciousness. It's worse if you're getting angry at the thought that someone wronged you, and you feel victimized. Your indignation won't change anything and may only worsen the situation. Instead, it's worth accepting this fact and gradually changing your perspective on yourself in the world around you.\nOften, we're not aware that we have something to forgive.\nThe simplest way to verify this is to observe yourself and answer these questions:\nDo people, family, or my surroundings annoy me? Do I have grievances?\nIf the answer is YES!, it means you have something to forgive someone for, and the energy you use to suppress it  (more on this in the book \"Be the Master of Your Life\").\nThe topic of so-called \"mirror consciousness\" is so vast that it could fill an entire book.\nHowever, I'll try to explain its essence as briefly and clearly as possible.\nMIRROR CONSCIOUSNESS\nPsychology refers to this as mirror neurons, but that doesn't fully capture the essence. In the therapeutic jargon I come from, we used to say, in simple terms, \"What bugs you is about you.\" If anything you encounter (words, images, behaviors, events) triggers negative associations, emotions, feelings, or retraumatizes you, it means there are unhealed negative perceptions, associations, or beliefs in your subconscious on that topic.\nEverything around you and everything you experience is like a mirror reflecting your soul and state of mind.\nYour reactions to what you experience are like mirror reflections telling the story of your soul.\nAll it takes is a skilled observer (your inner sage). This skill comes with experience and personal development. It comes with practice, not just knowledge.\nThese negative (unconscious associations and perceptions) are so-called unconscious intentions (expectations) that, from the \"background,\" attract events to you.\nHOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?\nThe emotional states they evoke generate a specific type of energy (vibration at a certain frequency). According to the law of attraction, this leads to attracting more similar emotional states.\nFor these to manifest, they must materialize as negative events in our lives. \" and the word became flesh,\" or more precisely, the thought becomes a word, and the word becomes flesh.\nIf your state of consciousness is at the stage of \"why is this happening to me, why am I being targeted,\" you're likely encoding a sense of victimhood. This gives rise to resentment toward God, the world, or people. You interpret it as someone wronging you.\n\"If God exists, He will have to beg me for forgiveness.\"\nThese words, reportedly scratched on the wall of a barracks in a concentration camp, are a perfect example of low \"mirror consciousness\" and a lack of understanding of the alchemy at play in the world (the law of cause and effect).\nAs you develop mirror consciousness and your inner master, this state will change. You'll stop blaming and start drawing conclusions that serve your further development.\nI've presented a very simplified model of event manifestation.\nIf the concepts of vibrations, energy, and attraction are unfamiliar to you, you may need to delve into quantum physics and bioenergetics. I've also written about this in \"Everything Is Energy\".\nYou can read more about unconscious intentions, such as guilt-punishment mechanisms, in my book \"Be the Master of Your Life\".
